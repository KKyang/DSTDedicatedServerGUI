# DSTDedicatedServerGUI
A Don't Starve Together Dedicated Server GUI.

**Still in heavy development. Backup your server before using it!

## Working OS

Windows

## What can it do

1. One click to start a new server.
2. Able to change basic server settings. ( Server name, descriptions...)

## Usage

1. Make sure the template folder is in the same directory as the executable.
2. If you want to change the world settings, navigate to the template folder and change the values inside worldgenoverride.lua directly.
3. Currently adding mods when creating new server is supported, but you'll have to manually edit the modoverrides.lua and put it into the template folder.
4. The app automatically search the token file in the default path. You can also assign the path manually.
5. You'll have to tell the app where the dedicated server's root directory location is.

## Future work

1. Able to change worldgenoverride.lua in GUI when creating a new server.
2. Able to manage mods in GUI.
3. Able to use custom server data folder path. ( Currently use the default path.)
