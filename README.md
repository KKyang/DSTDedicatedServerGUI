## Q & A

Q: Does this GUI supports adding mods?

A: Currently adding mods when creating new server is supported, but you'll have to manually edit the modoverrides.lua and put it into the template folder. The app supports updating mods, but you'll have to modify the dedicated_server_mods_setup.lua located at your dedicated server mods directory.

Q: What's the language of the GUI?

A: Currently it supports Traditional Chinese and English. I use Qt's Locale to detect the system automatically.

## Future work

1. Able to manage mods in GUI.
2. Able to use custom server data folder path. ( Currently use the default path.)
